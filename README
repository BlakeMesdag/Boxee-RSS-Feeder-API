Config file is location in inc/config.php

A templated database is NOT included, create a table called KeyPairs in a
database of your choosing, assign a read-only user and use those credentials
in inc/config.php.

All configuration should be done in config.php, you only need to make sure
your paths are correct. This version is probably broken as I haven't tested
the code changes and all the links will point to a subdir (TV).
